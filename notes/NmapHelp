1. ICMP Echo Request (Ping)

    What it Does: Sends a “ping” request (ICMP Echo Request) to see if a host responds, indicating it’s up.
    Example: You might use ping google.com in the command line. If Google’s server replies, it’s up; if it doesn’t, it might be down or blocking pings.
    Real-World Issue: Many servers now block these pings for security reasons, so not getting a response doesn’t always mean the host is down.

2. TCP SYN Ping

    What it Does: Sends a TCP packet with a SYN flag (used to start a TCP connection) to a specified port (e.g., port 80 for HTTP). If the port is open, the server responds with a SYN/ACK; if closed, it responds with a RST.
    Example: Running nmap -PS80 google.com sends a SYN packet to port 80 on Google’s server. If it responds, the server is likely up.
    Real-World Example: If a company’s web server is behind a firewall that blocks ICMP pings, but allows HTTP traffic, a SYN ping to port 80 can help you find out if the server is up.

3. TCP ACK Ping

    What it Does: Sends a TCP packet with an ACK flag (used to acknowledge data) to a specified port. The server should respond with a RST packet if it’s up.
    Example: Running nmap -PA80 google.com sends an ACK packet to port 80. A RST response indicates that the host is up, even if the port is closed.
    Real-World Example: If a firewall blocks SYN packets but allows ACK packets, this method helps bypass such firewalls.

4. UDP Ping

    What it Does: Sends a UDP packet to a specified port. If the port is closed, the server sends an ICMP “port unreachable” message. If open, it might not respond.
    Example: Running nmap -PU53 google.com sends a UDP packet to port 53 (DNS). If the server is up, you might receive a port unreachable message if port 53 is closed.
    Real-World Example: Useful when scanning networks where only UDP traffic is allowed through the firewall.

5. ICMP Ping Types

    What it Does: Sends different types of ICMP packets (e.g., echo requests, timestamp requests) to discover hosts.
    Example: nmap -PE google.com sends an ICMP Echo Request (ping). nmap -PP google.com sends an ICMP Timestamp Request.
    Real-World Example: When a server blocks traditional pings but responds to other ICMP types, using timestamp or address mask requests can still reveal the server’s presence.

6. IP Protocol Ping

    What it Does: Sends packets with different IP protocol numbers (e.g., ICMP, TCP, UDP) to see if the host responds or indicates the protocol is not supported.
    Example: nmap -PO1,2 google.com sends packets for ICMP and IGMP protocols. A response indicates the host is alive.
    Real-World Example: Useful for discovering hosts that respond to specific protocols not covered by standard pings.

7. ARP Scan

    What it Does: Sends ARP requests on a local network to discover active devices. ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses.
    Example: nmap -sn -PR 192.168.1.1/24 sends ARP requests to all IP addresses in the subnet 192.168.1.1/24. Devices that respond are up.
    Real-World Example: Ideal for scanning devices on a local network (like your home or office LAN) because ARP requests usually can't be blocked.

Summary

    ICMP Ping: Simple but less reliable due to firewall blocks.
    TCP SYN Ping: Good for discovering hosts by checking common ports like HTTP.
    TCP ACK Ping: Useful if firewalls block SYN but allow ACK.
    UDP Ping: Checks UDP ports; useful when firewalls only filter TCP.
    ICMP Ping Types: Explores different ICMP types for host discovery.
    IP Protocol Ping: Checks various IP protocols to see if the host is alive.
    ARP Scan: Best for local networks, as ARP requests are hard to block.

These techniques help in finding out if a host is online and responding, even if traditional methods fail due to modern security measures.
